    <p class="paragraph-25">The crypto space has been hot recently. The adoption of crypto is huge and is likely to increase in the future. No longer in the shadows, cryptocurrency is now a part of the mainstream and it is definitely going to have an effect worldwide. In the field of real estate too, many developers have been asking for payments in digital currencies like Bitcoin. We have seen the interests of people grow in purchasing and selling property via NFTs or Non-fungible tokens. <br>‍<br><strong class="bold-text-5">What are NFT’s-<br>‍</strong><br>NFT’s are digital tokens that can be bought with cryptocurrency. They provide safe and complete ownership of all digital assets through Blockchain (a public ledger across a network).<br>The Founder of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington, had listed his apartment in Ukraine for sale, via NFT, which supports real estate. This was marketed as the first global real estate NFT and it sold for over $93,000. Some other real estate developers have recently managed to sell luxury units through NFT’s in Portugal as well. People who wish to own or sell properties in the future can now manage their property with a single click through blockchain-enabled technology. <br>The transactions in this field through NFT come with a lot of conditions. There are still many doubts that are related to NFT’s and their legality.<br>Major points to note: According to industry experts, the future of NFT’s in the real estate industry will only work if the legal ownership provisions are integrated into the procedure. We will have to wait for blockchain integration into the real estate industry and its processes. Some experts also are of the opinion that the real estate NFTs are still a unique aspect for many. There is not much relevance to them and the actual paperwork will still be a procedure simultaneously. Unless there is sole ownership, the NFT will have no value. Many people are investing in NFT and the future of NFTs in the real estate industry looks bright. However, the traditional procedure is going to be the norm according to experts. There is still a long road ahead for NFTs as long as their worldwide adoption is concerned. Whether NFT’s are here to stay or not, they are for sure opening up new avenues in the digital world.</p>
