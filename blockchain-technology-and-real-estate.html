  <p class="paragraph-27"><strong class="bold-text-10">What is Blockchain Technology?</strong><br><br>To answer this in a simple way- This is a system where all transactions and records are maintained across a network of computers. These transactions can be in any form, your bank details, any property selling or purchasing details, or any other transactions of any kind. In a nutshell, Blockchain Technology provides us with various records of transactions in a safe and secure way. Given Blockchain’s interference with the applications across various industries, it’s hard to find a section that has not been influenced by this technology. Bitcoin being the first blockchain application launched as a digital currency system that didn’t require a bank. The Initial coin offerings have changed the way industries function. The food industry to the real estate industries has been impacted. Real estate has not been able to escape the Blockchain effect as well.  We know that transactions of high values assets in real estate were never done digitally. The transactions are mostly conducted offline involving face-to-face meetings with the parties involved. Blockchain, however, changed this norm. With the introduction of smart contracts, real estate assets can now be sold or purchased digitally. Blockchain has removed the need for middlemen out of the transactions in the real estate business. This as a whole has reduced the costs. Imagine if there is a record of property that is verified and it allows parties to deal without knowing each other without the fear of being duped. This is the potential Blockchain Technology shows for the future of the Real Estate Industry. We can say that there are many benefits of using blockchain technology in the real estate industry. One can change titles, do price negotiations, and even buy and sell the property digitally. This technology basically simplifies every step involved in the real estate industry.<br><strong class="bold-text-11"><br>Impacts of Blockchain Technology on the Real Estate Industry<br>‍</strong><br>‍<strong>Transparency- </strong>Blockchain has the ability to provide verifiable proof as to who owns the property. It even can provide information if there are any open claims against the property.<br>‍<strong>Automated Legal Agreements- </strong>All the leases, purchases, and sales agreements can be made in a way that the specific actions are updated automatically once a target is met.<br>‍<strong>Payments- </strong>Blockchain will reduce the transaction time to seconds from days and months. This would cost just pennies as the transaction fees.<br>‍<strong>Fractional Ownership- </strong>Mostly a seller has to wait for a long time to sell his property at the right price when there are no potential buyers available. With this technology, sellers can tokenize their properties into real estate shares that can be owned by several investors.<br><strong class="bold-text-12"><br>Investing in the real estate market<br>‍</strong><br>Blockchain technology has ensured an effective and efficient way of investing in the real estate market. This technology will empower individual investors who always wanted to buy and sell on their terms and conditions. Blockchain Technology is here to bring about a major change in the way people used to function in the Real Estate Industry. This technology will prove to be a catalyst that will provide help to many investors entering the real estate sector.</p>
