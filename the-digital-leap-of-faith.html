    <p class="paragraph-28">Digitalization and Real Estate could not be associated with one another a decade ago. The real estate industry has always been perceived as being slow in adopting new processes and also for being frozen at times. This is one industry that everyone is concerned with directly or indirectly as compared to other industries. The need to buy or rent a house is a major decision as well as a concern for everyone. Hence the digitalization of the industry is essential as well as inevitable.<br>‍<br>Within the real estate industry, the introduction to digitalization has brought about a change in the way it used to carry out its functions. However, the fact that we are still looking for real estate agents to book houses and look at properties, shows that the industry is not fully transformed. We are not far away from the day when the real estate agents will disappear from the industry, as nearly 90 pct of the people search for houses and other real estate requirements online.<br>‍<br>As we all know that the real estate industry has since long been under the influence of a few majorly established players. With the arrival of new technologies and new players, the Prop-tech network is expanding and creating many business opportunities. Many tech companies have started making solutions and apps that are helping in generating revenue. These smart solutions are covering all the pain points of the real estate industry. The change is gradual and the processes are becoming easier day by day. Digitalization has today made it possible for a person to visit a house virtually. Sales, contracts, and even deals are done online. The customers seem to be satisfied with these smart solutions which bring a boost to the real estate industry as a whole. The lengthy processes are now shorter and safer, with many such solutions, the prop-tech companies are now being able to carve a different path compared to the processes a decade ago. <br>‍<br>Today many professionals are still not very accustomed and comfortable with digitalization and face challenges every day. But soon, with more and more prop-tech companies joining in, the industry will adapt to the new process and get accustomed to it. As long as it adds value for professionals as well as customers, the change of the whole process in the real estate industry is being welcomed. <br>‍<br>Since digital technology is here to stay, the real estate middlemen will either have to learn the new ways or simply risk being redundant in the market. The process of digitization will make the whole process less time-consuming, much safer, and more secure in terms of deals. Users should get ready to experience some great and exciting deals meanwhile the industry continues to grow at a fast pace.</p>
