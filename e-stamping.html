    <p class="paragraph-26"><strong class="bold-text-6">What is E-Stamping</strong><br><br>Buying and selling or renting a property involve payment of stamp duty to the Government. For any successful property transaction, it is essential to pay the stamp duty. Earlier it was done at the sub-registrar&#x27;s office by being present physically but now due to digitization, most of these processes are done online. A stamp paper of a value decided by the Government is purchased and the payment is made, this is proof that you have paid the Government the required fee. Nowadays, for all those who are tech-savvy, e-stamping is the easiest way to pay the stamp duty. The Government Of India had launched the e-stamping facility back in 2013, July. 2013 to try to minimize fraud and mistakes during the payment of stamp duty. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the advantages of E-Stamping.<br>‍<br><strong class="bold-text-7">Advantages of E-Stamping<br>‍<br></strong>The process takes a few minutes to complete compared to the long queues outside the registrar&#x27;s office. Because the E stamp has a unique identification number, it is not possible to tamper with it. The genuineness and originality can be confirmed through the inquiry module. 
      <br><br> <strong class="bold-text-7"> Disadvantages:- </strong><br><br>Like two sides of a coin, there are a few disadvantages as well, In case of loss of the certificate, a duplicate cannot be issued. Although the payment is online, the certificate has to be picked physically. In a few cases, a late fee is also charged. Pandemic effect on E-Stamping<br>Due to the pandemic, the Government had reinforced that people should make the payments of stamp duty through E- Stamping only. Currently, this online facility is available in states like NCT- Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujrat, Karnataka, Odisha, Chandigarh, Tripura, Puducherry, Jammu and Kashmir, and Andaman And Nicobar Islands. In case one has to get an E-Stamp generated, the company to connect with is The Stock Holding Company of India (SHCIL). It is the central agency that is responsible for the processing of the e-stamping documents. SCHIL has collaborations with various banks that act as collection centers. The payment can be made through various modes. Some of them are mentioned below. <br>cash, cheque, Pay order RTGS Demand draft NEFT Account to account transfer.<br>‍<br>Following are some frequently asked questions related to E- Stamping.<br>Can the stamp duty be edited? No, once it is generated, no changes can be made.<br>Is the signature required for an E Stamp? Yes, the signature will be taken digitally. <br><br><strong class="bold-text-8">Till when is an E Stamp Valid?<br>‍</strong><br>The E-stamp is valid for 180 days from the date of payment made a refund possible?<br>The refund has to be initiated within 6 months and it will be refunded after deducting 10 percent of the Stamp Duty paid initially.<br><strong class="bold-text-9"><br>Conclusion<br>‍</strong><br>In the end, we can say that E-Stamping will lead to a lot less corruption and increase transparency in the real estate processes. Since India has a lot of rural population and they don&#x27;t have all the required knowledge about technology, it sure will be a challenge to get the real estate processes online. But the hurdles will be crossed and E Stamping and other online processes will become the standard norm in the real estate industry soon.</p>
